# Project Information
Our group set out to create a dynamic, user-interactive dashboard showcasing inspiring women from around the world through the means of the world map, graphs, and other visually pleasing tools.

Sources we used are:
* https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-12-08
* https://www.worldathletics.org/records/by-category/world-records

We webscraped these links above to extract the needed data and translate into interactive and intuitive visualization tools.

We used D3, HTML, CSS, Javascript to create an interactive flask app that displays various different cleaned data. 

Run the app.py by calling `$flask run` or `$python app.py`.
