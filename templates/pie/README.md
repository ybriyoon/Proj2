# graphs-from-csv

I've been attempting to draw a pie chart (from chart library) with parsed CSV data (complete_data.csv). I want to show country distribution. I use c3.js and PapaParse.

### Graph/Chart Library

### CSV/JSON Parsing Library
PapaParse: http://papaparse.com/

### Only Requirement
You need a web server. I used python to initiate a web server.


```
python -m http.server
```
